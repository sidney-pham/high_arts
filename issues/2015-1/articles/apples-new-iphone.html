  <h1 id="the-iphone-7-apple-s-new-product-has-received-very-low-ratings-on-ebay-but-still-has-had-an-insane-amount-of-purchases-">The IPhone 7, Apple’s new product has received very low ratings on eBay but still has had an insane amount of purchases.</h1>
<p>All the newest features of this phone are that it is bigger, thinner, it can hold more space and it’s waterproof.</p>
<p>“Apple haven’t been coming up with very innovative products since the IPad….’ Quotes a non-impressed customer.</p>
<p>Although some people are aboard the Apple hype train, lots of people aren’t so sure and have began to look what the difference is between these different costly products.</p>
<p>The current price of the IPhone 7 is $10000 which is out of the price range of most people and also is the size of an IPad mini which needs to held with two hands and when dropped, cracks appear instantaneously. With the “new” “smart keyboard” which costs an extra $1000 it becomes a clear copy of the new windows surface pro 5.</p>
<p>It even has apple watch integration but let’s be honest. No one will waste $1000 on a watch which is like your phone but with a smaller screen. Apple also seemed to have upped the sound level on their microphone as now siri cant hear normal  talking and someone has to look like an idiot and yell at their phone. These facts can clearly show why you would ever buy the IPhone 7 we rate it 10/10.</p>
