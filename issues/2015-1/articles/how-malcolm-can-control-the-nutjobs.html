  <p>Kevin Rudd may be a flawed man, but he’s certainly a politically astute one. Which is why, earlier this month, people took notice when he appeared on <em>The Project</em> to say: “Malcolm’s got his own challenges. He’s gotta deal with the lunar right of his party, and there are some serious nutjobs there. We all know that.”</p>
<p>Setting aside the predictably flowery language, Rudd’s statement reflects what all of us are anticipating over the next few years. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is obviously a fine leader and a skilful politician, but he bears the cross of political awkwardness, as most centrists do in the two-party system.</p>
<p>Mr 69% (as dubbed by the Herald) has the mandate of the public to do most things he reasonably wants. But the obvious hypocrisy of changing leaders and the emotions attached to the Abbott era caused a stir. Some in the party think Turnbull to be rash and overconfident. Labor thinks him to be a sell-out.</p>
<p>Particularly, rumours are circulating about Canberra’s nutjobs causing Turnbull some issues as he has settled into his new office. This is the same group of people who voted for Kevin Andrews as deputy leader in the recent spill.</p>
<p>The faction to be concerned with is a sizeable minority with sizeable power. Cory Bernardi, Kevin Andrews, Warren Truss and Eric Abetz are the biggest names floated around. For these men, “nutjob” really is an appropriate term.</p>
<p>Malcolm Turnbull has long described himself as a “conviction politician” and we know from past experience that he’s got a teensy bit of a leftie conviction. Well, more than a teensy bit. He proved this by crossing the floor on the ETS in 2010, amongst other acts.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs say that he promised to keep Direct Action, the ridiculous marriage equality plebiscite, and the Murray Darling Basin policy the same as they were under Abbott. Anthony Albanese called it selling out to become leader. Turnbull called it losing the battle to win the war. Well, inside his head at least.</p>
<p>But I don’t think good ol’ Malcolm is going to give up that easily. Certainly he’s passionate about his progressive solutions, as everyone around him has pleaded for years, but how can he get them through the Coalition caucus in this term or the next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Erode affiliations and heal the stubbornness of the Abbott past.</li>
<li>Good rhetoric. Reframe debate and change the imperatives.</li>
<li>Dirty work. Deals, cash-flow and blindsiding anyone that requires it.</li>
<li>Jules and Scotty. Bishop and Morrison are shiny, fresh tools to use effectively.</li>
<li>Mr 69% needs to keep that number up or he’s got a war on two fronts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind, those five will ensure he is able to fulfil the expectations of the swinging population, but it’ll take a while and involves a whole lot of sacrifices.</p>
<p>Even so, how sad a day it is when the nutjobs of politics are holding us back as a nation. Maybe we should at least <em>think</em> about Labor here. Most of their nutjobs went and joined the Greens, despite what Kevin Rudd is still salty about.</p>
