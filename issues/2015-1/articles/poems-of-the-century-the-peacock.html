  <p>When you go inside your city zoo,                                                              Then alas, a storm did rise</p>
<p>You should remember what you should do,                                             As if Zeus was angry at the peacock’s pride,</p>
<p>To visit the most pretty of all,                                                                     And a lightning bolt fell towards the ground,</p>
<p>The peacock will no doubt enthral,                                                            It came for the bird like a hungry hound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rumour has it the peacock is odd,                                                            But the peacock with all its vanity, it did boast,</p>
<p>In a good way, (it was made by the Gods)                                               As if saying ‘am I not better than most?</p>
<p>Venus, yes her. She gave it its looks,                                                        This lightning bolt, it will not defeat me,</p>
<p>The ones better than any bird in the books,                                           For my beauty around me, it will protect me!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The peacock, its feathers and its mane,                                                 It was despairing, to see the peacock fall,</p>
<p>And its extreme ego will make you insane,                                           Your Highness, once great, was now to crawl,</p>
<p>As it prances and dances and enchants everything,                            In anguish and shame, of its hideous looks,</p>
<p>The peacock, yes, it is dressed just like a king.                                     That was uglier than any bird of the books,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heaven looks down on its beautiful plumage,                                    I stared at the bird, that was once exalted,</p>
<p>A sight never seen, from age to age,                                                    But now, my enchantment had now faltered,</p>
<p>I was there at its cage, and stared with the awe,                               For if you cannot humble yourself,</p>
<p>That comes to you when you see waves on the shore,                    The Gods, they will reduce you to an ugly little shell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stood there watching, as if all the time in the world,                     Don’t let your vanity and pride prevail,</p>
<p>Had stopped in its place, at this wonderful bird,                               Don’t exalt yourself, for a fire of hail,</p>
<p>With all its beauty and vanity, it stood in its glory,                           Will come to you at the peak of your boast,</p>
<p>As if it was supreme with immortality,                                                And bring you down to some sand on the coast.</p>
