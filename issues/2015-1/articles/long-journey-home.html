  <p>After clearing Customs in Tan Son Nhut Airport, I walked out onto Truong Son Road filled, as it was, with the fumes of the myriads of motorbikes and taxis packed together so tightly on the crowded street. I could also feel the humid air brushing my face.</p>
<p>The day of my arrival was an exceptionally busy day because it was Vietnamese New Year’s Eve. Bounteous amounts of red and yellow festive decorations crowded the streets. Shops lined up along the side of the road were selling traditional Vietnamese food; luckily I was starving so my mum let me buy one container of rice paper rolls. They were delicious!!</p>
<p>Looking around Saigon, I could feel the energy in the air. Non-stop talk was coming from all directions; there was no doubt that the colours played a huge impact on the vibrancy of this celebration. Marching bands were parading down the street, there were dragons dancing and prancing, writhing their way down the road, pictures of rabbits surrounded the area, lanterns shook above us and drums were beating.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud whistling noise caught everyone by surprise and a large firework exploded, I could see that this marked the beginning of the long night before Tet.</p>
<p>The money mum had given me was burning a hole in my pocket so I began looking around for food and souvenirs. Shops were selling fruits and meats; they even had a rabbit shop!!</p>
<p>The sweetly pungent smell of rotting fruit combined with the fumes of petrol and gas from roaring motorcycles and humid air to create an horrific stench which spread through the street. I didn’t manage to find a souvenir on that night but instead I found a secluded small shop just off the main street.</p>
<p>As I walked inside, there were people producing stunning artwork using eggshells and by the information on the walls, their parents were the victims of Agent Orange. What I noticed about this shop was that, compared to the loud, stinky, crowded shops of the marketplace, this shop was quiet and calm.</p>
<p>“A much better workplace,” I thought.</p>
<p>Walking around the little gallery, I felt sympathy for these people and their misfortunes and troubles they’d gone through. All their feelings were expressed in their art filled as it was with images of pain and suffering. Here I found a beautiful ceramic teapot which I decided to buy as my souvenir.</p>
<p>When I was told that we were going to go to Vietnam in 2011, I wasn’t really excited. I couldn’t get memories of horrific traffic, a city where rubbish cluttered the pavements, people loitering everywhere and their English so very difficult to understand, people who have no respect for outsiders.</p>
<p>However I eventually realised that despite the traffic, the tardiness of the people, the heat, the lack of English, most of the people were very nice to foreigners. Through my experiences, I was given the opportunity to reconnect with my Vietnamese culture and family. Every place I visited gave me a little hint about another aspect of my culture, my heritage, my family’s history.</p>
