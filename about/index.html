  <p>It’s easy to get too used to being a student.</p>
<p>At school, we’re students of our teachers. At home, we’re students of our parents. In life, we’re students of our role models. Being a student can sometimes encapsulate us, but what’s often forgotten is our ability to teach back our knowledge.</p>
<p>Sydney Boys High is a place where everybody has a different passion, everybody has different skills and everybody has a different array of knowledge. Any individual may be somewhat skilled or knowledgeable on their own, but combined, those abilities are immeasurable. This magazine aims to fill a void at school. The void of student teaching.</p>
<p>The astute editors of this magazine recognised the huge plethora of insight available, and have harnessed it to create an ongoing medium where High boys can express themselves freely. This is a magazine where we can teach back the ideas, the work, the art and more that we’ve created. No-one should feel embarrassed or ashamed of their work here, because we all recognise the value of our fellow High boy’s ideas and effort.</p>
<p>Too many great pieces go unread, too many great artworks go unseen and too many great ideas go unconsidered. Hopefully, we’ve developed a platform where that unfortunate fact is addressed. It doesn’t matter if someone’s in Year 7 or Year 12, what matters is the effort and remarkable collaboration students throughout the school showed in this pursuit. Even in the testing, marketing and development phases of the magazine. The whole of the school has come together and acted as an amazing uniform, streamlined body to create this. Not one teacher touched this. At all. This is a completely student-led initiative, with one goal in mind: to transfer the power of the media to the expressive, creative and proud student. And now, the expressive, creative and proud teacher. Wow.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
