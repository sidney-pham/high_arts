  <p>Staring at this sandstone hall reminds me of that time I was looking through the pyramids in Egypt. Those creamy walls covered in gooey moss and hanging vines. Weird menacing plants popping out amongst those vines, with green and purple gas coming out of them. With beetles crawling around the tunnel and the cracks in the ceiling, I think the roof is going to fall in.</p>
<p>“Come on Sally, we’re waiting.”</p>
<p>I turn around and see Abe, the leader of this expedition. Abe and I have been friends ever since we met at University. At least I know him. Marco is so nervous he’s going to fall for one of the traps in this Labyrinth. And Peart seems okay, but I have this feeling about him.</p>
<p>“Coming,” I reply.</p>
<p>We walk through the dark entrance and see four paths. Abe lights four torches, one for each of us. This expedition is about finding the lost treasure of Arcani, but with so many places to go, it could be anywhere! I look among the walls; feel the roughness of the sandstones, smell the dead rats and beetles lingering around, see the ancient hieroglyphs among the walls. I just love it!</p>
<p>“Okay, guys, let’s start mapping where we’re going so we aren’t lost?”</p>
<p>“What if we split up so we can cover more area? That way we can find the centre of the maze quicker,” Pert suggested.</p>
<p>A minute later we were deciding which way we would go and where we would meet. I mean, this is one of the most dangerous labyrinths in the world. I take my piece of paper and split up from the rest of the group. I have been chosen to take the left path, so I take my torch and follow the path. I make little marks among these deserted corridors, that way I know how to come back.</p>
<p>After several metres of twists and turns I hear a creak. The walls are starting to move closer and close in on me! I see a hole in the roof. I run to below the hole, wait for just the right amount of time, then I scurry up the two walls and into the hole.</p>
<p>Easy. Too easy. ‘Swoosh’. I hear the noise of high pressure water. I turn around and see geysers in the walls with hot water shooting out of them. And when I say hot, I mean lava hot. The water is filling up the room quickly. The steam is clogging up the air. The labyrinth gods obviously know I’m asthmatic. I see a set of stairs at the other end of the tunnel. I climb up them to try and escape this boiling pot of soup.</p>
