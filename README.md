Eight years old
walking under the bridge
scrub, swamp
abandoned machinery
inside of tennis balls
bits of fences
meeting the boys
at the dam
bikes in a pile
skater shoe soles
not cold in
never is
boys talking about mangoes
slapping water
some have never had one 
listen to the taste
the squeeze of a cheek
dripping chins
a dog jumps in
they pull on tufts of hair
fill ears with mud
breeze full
cloud break
they remember my birthday
is tomorrow
