  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is absolutely appalling that Turkey and other NATO countries are supporting or funding ISIS either directly or indirectly. The fact that a Russian SU-24M frontline bomber was downed by the Turks after it &#8216;violated&#8217; Turkish airspace is even more unjust. This action just highlights the evil, impudent regime in Turkey, one which has a lack of modesty to stand up to its crime and sincerely apologise to the Russians straightaway for the deliberate downing, instead of shaking its heads and fearfully calling an emergency NATO meeting. What is also disgraceful is the baseless evidence Turkey provided to support its claims that SU-24 entered Turkish airspace for just 17 seconds before leaving the border. Turkey also has claimed that they sent 10 warnings before downing the plane, which is impossible if we suppose that the plane was indeed in Turkey for just 17 seconds. But in fact, the plane was never within metres of the border, never crossed the border even for a second and certainly did not receive any warnings from Turkey. One of the pilots who has luckily survived the incident has now stated that the bomber did not send any warnings and that the bomber just flew in secretly from behind, meaning that the pilots did not even get to see the bomber before the downing. Remember, the Turkish bomber F-16 is no match to Russia&#8217;s SU-24, which was manufactured over 30 years ago!!! So it is quite clear that the Turks are responsible for the incident and that the Russian bomber never flew into Turkish territory. If that had been the case, the US would have immediately published GPS data of the location of the plane, but since the GPS data shows that the plane crashed 4km away from the border, the US could do nothing but incite some more propaganda, just like it did back when MH-17 crashed&#8230; And what is most disgraceful out of all, is that the US and almost every other ally has declared solidarity with the perpetrators, the Turks, instead of with Russia. (which can only be purely politically-motivated).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This incident has come at the wrong time &#8211; a time when it looked like cooperation between the US allies and Russia was strengthening. It is pivotal that we condemn this incident and look at closer cooperation if both we and the US are serious about defeating ISIS sooner, rather than later. Remember, ISIS makes a lot of money on selling oil to Turkey, so it is crucial to stop these trading networks to make the job much easier. I congratulate all the many American, Russian, European, Asian and Australian media organisations who have the guts to stand up for the truth and to not get brainwashed from the propaganda being desperately made by the US and Rupert Murdoch. It is truly grateful that Australia now has newspapers, such as the Australian National Review, which are independent and are unbiased in their coverage. I suggest that you all take a copy of the Australian National Review this weekend, or go online to see the countless unbiased articles which provide further information on events in Syria, Ukraine and places all over the world. My dream is that all the major media empires will one day understand the catastrophic consequences that come when they brainwash their citizens with senseless crap and will realise the unlimited benefits in becoming truly unbiased and independent. (not like the SMH, which claims to be forever independent)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is up to all of you to realise the importance of unbiased media coverage and to take a stand for the truth. The future of media and foreign relations lie in your handsâ€¦</span></p>
