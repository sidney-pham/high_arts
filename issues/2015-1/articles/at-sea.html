  <p>I am held in its serrated jaw; realisation stabs me; I stare agape at the towering mountain. Icy water sloshes over my fur boot. The sun has barely risen and mist emits from my mouth. Wind billows at the near-paper sails as I tug on the strings – forming an eccentric dim-dappled pattern. Thirst dangles me over the edge of Death’s door. I am stuck in my own maelstrom of madness … or is this the reality? I am driven purely by hunger, I am desperate for the meat that I tasted &#8211; meat which now only exists as a fantasy. Sailing further away from life; rowing further away from life; but closer than ever to Death’s door. The towering mountain fills my vision, rocks jut out of the mountain front. Abruptly, a flash of grey enters my peripheral. I close my eye lids and open then cautiously under the surging sails. I manage a glimpse to the left, a glimpse to the right. I creep forward to the starboard – slowly … ever so slowly. My heart races faster; my mouth is agape; the hair on my back stands to attention. I am as helpless as an autumn leaf following the whirlpool of a drain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grasp the strings of the sails. I feel the harsh ropes cutting into my rough hands – the well-worked hands of a sailor. I slide myself to the floor of the deck and remain still … ever so still. I watch the billowing near-paper sails flapping to and fro. I am mesmerised. Hunger gnaws deep, deep in my stomach. Sheer terror overwhelms me as an ominous shadow fills the boat, the fragile, flimsy boat. I collapse onto the deck face down, knowing that I cannot fight the hunger, knowing that I cannot fight the terror. I give up! I take a final glace at the silhouette above and black out.</p>
