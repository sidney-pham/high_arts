I could also feel the humid air brushing my face.\n\nThe day of my arrival was an exceptionally busy day because it was Vietnamese New Year\u2019s Eve. Bounteous amounts of red and yellow festive decorations crowded the streets. Shops lined up along the side of the road were selling traditional Vietnamese food; luckily I was starving so my mum let me buy one container of rice paper rolls. They were delicious!!\n\nLooking around Saigon, I could feel the energy in the air. Non-stop talk was coming from all directions; there was no doubt that the colours played a huge impact on the vibrancy of this celebration. Marching bands were parading down the street, there were dragons dancing and prancing, writhing their way down the road, pictures of rabbits surrounded the area, lanterns shook above us and drums were beating.\n\nSuddenly, a loud whistling noise caught everyone by surprise and a large firework exploded, I could see that this marked the beginning of the long night before Tet.\n\nThe money mum had given me was burning a hole in my pocket so I began looking around for food and souvenirs. Shops were selling fruits and meats; they even had a rabbit shop!!\n\nThe sweetly pungent smell of rotting fruit combined with the fumes of petrol and gas from roaring motorcycles and humid air to create an horrific stench which spread through the street. I didn\u2019t manage to find a souvenir on that night but instead I found a secluded small shop just off the main street.\n\nAs I walked inside, there were people producing stunning artwork using eggshells and by the information on the walls, their parents were the victims of Agent Orange. What I noticed about this shop was that, compared to the loud, stinky, crowded shops of the marketplace, this shop was quiet and calm.\n\n\u201cA much better workplace,\u201d I thought.\n\nWalking around the little gallery, I felt sympathy for these people and their misfortunes and troubles they\u2019d gone through. All their feelings were expressed in their art filled as it was with images of pain and suffering. Here I found a beautiful ceramic teapot which I decided to buy as my souvenir.\n\nWhen I was told that we were going to go to Vietnam in 2011, I wasn\u2019t really excited. I couldn\u2019t get memories of horrific traffic, a city where rubbish cluttered the pavements, people loitering everywhere and their English so very difficult to understand, people who have no respect for outsiders.\n\nHowever I eventually realised that despite the traffic, the tardiness of the people, the heat, the lack of English, most of the people were very nice to foreigners. Through my experiences, I was given the opportunity to reconnect with my Vietnamese culture and family. Every place I visited gave me a little hint about another aspect of my culture, my heritage, my family\u2019s history.\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>By\u00a0&#8212;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>After clearing Customs in Tan Son Nhut Airport, I walked out onto Truong Son Road filled, as it was, with the fumes of the myriads of motorbikes and taxis packed together so tightly on the crowded street.

This action just highlights the evil, impudent regime in Turkey, one which has a lack of modesty to stand up to its crime and sincerely apologise to the Russians straightaway for the deliberate downing, instead of shaking its heads and fearfully calling an emergency NATO meeting. What is also disgraceful is the baseless evidence Turkey provided to support its claims that SU-24 entered Turkish airspace for just 17 seconds before leaving the border. Turkey also has claimed that they sent 10 warnings before downing the plane, which is impossible if we suppose that the plane was indeed in Turkey for just 17 seconds. But in fact, the plane was never within metres of the border, never crossed the border even for a second and certainly did not receive any warnings from Turkey. One of the pilots who has luckily survived the incident has now stated that the bomber did not send any warnings and that the bomber just flew in secretly from behind, meaning that the pilots did not even get to see the bomber before the downing. Remember, the Turkish bomber F-16 is no match to Russia\u2019s SU-24, which was manufactured over 30 years ago!!! So it is quite clear that the Turks are responsible for the incident and that the Russian bomber never flew into Turkish territory. If that had been the case, the US would have immediately published GPS data of the location of the plane, but since the GPS data shows that the plane crashed 4km away from the border, the US could do nothing but incite some more propaganda, just like it did back when MH-17 crashed\u2026 And what is most disgraceful out of all, is that the US and almost every other ally has declared solidarity with the perpetrators, the Turks, instead of with Russia.

Manhattan is a large island, approximately 21 kilometres long or over 250 blocks (admittedly short ones) from the Bronx to the Financial District. I found myself right at the top of the island on one tourist outing, and as an avid public transport enthusiast, I was working out the best way to get back to midtown\/downtown.\n\nThe Subway was the clear winner, but I was near a bus station and I was curious about the merits of New York City buses. So I did some research and, according to the MTA\u2019s website, two Subway trains would take me 51 minutes to scale the island, including walking time. Not bad.\n\nTwo buses (on virtually direct routes) would have taken me 3 hours and 11 minutes. Ouch. Keep in mind this is roughly the distance from Sydney\u2019s CBD to Bankstown, which takes less than an hour and a half on buses in peak hour.\n\nThe traffic in New York City is up there with the worst in the world. If it weren\u2019t for such an extensive and (for the most part) reliable underground system, the city would probably implode with the pressure of such great population density.\n\nIn Sydney, 59% of commuters drive to work every day. In NYC, that figure is down at 28%. Even then, the major roadways simply don\u2019t flow most of the time.\n\nAs Sydney becomes more like New York in housing, culture and economy, since my trip I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s also becoming more like it in terms of road congestion. This is bad.\n\nSo the key to beating traffic absolutely lies in getting people onto public transport and out of their cars. The New York Subway is so good because there\u2019s lots **of** it, but NYC\u2019s roads are so bad because there\u2019s lots **on** it.\n\nHere\u2019s what I would do:\n\n- Invest more in public transport and less in roads. New York has 34 Subway lines, Sydney has 17 (including Olympic Park and Cronulla offshoots). More trains, buses, train lines, bus lanes, light rail, ferries at regular intervals in as many places as possible. Close the blackspots on the Northern Beaches and elsewhere. Make it faster and easier to get on a train or bus. Play people\u2019s incentives by expanding the whole system.\n\n\u00a0\n\n- Ban all private vehicles in the CBD all the time. Accept buses, cyclists, taxis and government delivery vehicles only. London has a congestion tax, but I think that\u2019s regressive and unfair. If a rich person wants a fast route into the CBD, they can catch a taxi. The CBD is the centre of the daily commute and cannot practically entertain all of the cars it does at the moment. Plus, this solution would turn the city beautifully cosmopolitan. Pitt Street mall on every street.\n\nThe second solution simply must be used in conjunction with the first, but the benefit to the economy from quicker commute times will offset and actually improve initial investments for the NSW Government. I want the trains of New York City with the roads of a country town, all in Sydney.\n\nI can add so much more detail to this article, but I thought it best to be brief. So if you don\u2019t want a 3-hour trip to Bankstown, or do, I\u2019d love to chat\/answer questions.\n\nAlso read this he\u2019s more eloquent than I am: [http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/victoria\/should-we-ban-cars-from-melbournes-cbd-20150413-1mjuvr.html](http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/victoria\/should-we-ban-cars-from-melbournes-cbd-20150413-1mjuvr.html)\n\nBy Hugh Bartley\n\n\n","html":"<p>I travelled to New York recently. Manhattan is a large island, approximately 21 kilometres long or over 250 blocks (admittedly short ones) from the Bronx to the Financial District. I found myself right at the top of the island on one tourist outing, and as an avid public transport enthusiast, I was working out the best way to get back to midtown\/downtown.<\/p>\n<p>The Subway was the clear winner, but I was near a bus station and I was curious about the merits of New York City buses. So I did some research and, according to the MTA\u2019s website, two Subway trains would take me 51 minutes to scale the island, including walking time. Not bad.<\/p>\n<p>Two buses (on virtually direct routes) would have taken me 3 hours and 11 minutes. Ouch. Keep in mind this is roughly the distance from Sydney\u2019s CBD to Bankstown, which takes less than an hour and a half on buses in peak hour.<\/p>\n<p>The traffic in New York City is up there with the worst in the world. If it weren\u2019t for such an extensive and (for the most part) reliable underground system, the city would probably implode with the pressure of such great population density.<\/p>\n<p>In Sydney, 59% of commuters drive to work every day. In NYC, that figure is down at 28%. Even then, the major roadways simply don\u2019t flow most of the time.<\/p>\n<p>As Sydney becomes more like New York in housing, culture and economy, since my trip I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s also becoming more like it in terms of road congestion. This is bad.<\/p>\n<p>So the key to beating traffic absolutely lies in getting people onto public transport and out of their cars. The New York Subway is so good because there\u2019s lots <strong>of<\/strong> it, but NYC\u2019s roads are so bad because there\u2019s lots <strong>on<\/strong> it.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I would do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest more in public transport and less in roads.

Change: A Very Serious Issue","slug":"temp-slug-19","markdown":"\nIn wake of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris [COP21], it is evident that the issue of climate change is now more important than ever, and with greenhouse gas emissions rising every day, it is paramount that a resolution is found for this problem.\n\nCoined as \u201cAction Day\u201d, the conference seeks to \u2018achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world.\u2019 However, the controversial topic remains; will a mere conference solve one of the biggest problems humanity as ever faced? A prime example occurred in 2009, with the holding of a similar Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen [COP15]. What emerged from that conference was a bunch of international delegates who had done little to nothing to mitigate the severity of global warming, with international press calling climate talks in \u2018serious disarray\u2019. And so they have done it again but this time in 2015, inviting international delegations from all over the world and saying, \u2018this is the day we change\u2019, only this time it\u2019s legally binding.\n\nSee, my friends and I used to say the exact same phrase after receiving a sub-par mark in an exam; \u2018I\u2019m going to change this\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m going to change that\u2019. But even so, the next assessment came and we were greeted with yet another sub-par mark. Only the difference between this and Paris is that our changes to our study habits weren\u2019t legally binding, and we quickly returned to our inherent habits of procrastination and loafing around. We as students only changed when we stopped talking about how motivated we are and instead bent our heads over and started writing our next essay or doing more practise questions, and that reflected in our marks after we received them.\n\nSo it all comes down to the fact whether if politicians and governments are willing to knuckle down on greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and other causes of global warming, and provide enough funding to find a renewable and sustainable energy source by halfway through the century. One thing I know for sure is that it can be done. There was a time around five or six decades ago when the Space Race has just begun. NASA received funding equivalent to 4% of the national budget, and we put the first man on the moon within three years. This shows that we as humans are not lacking in our ability, but we are lacking in our will. If people around the world put aside their greed for profit and production, we would be able to live in a world much cleaner than it currently is. But the issue remains, are people willing to abandon their greed for the greater good? Or will governments have to force people to do so?\n\nBut already, the press has hailed the Paris climate talks as \u2018yielding a first draft amidst air of optimism\u2019. So it might be a good sign after all, but we should also be thankful that these countries all over the world are willing to come together as one and solve a problem that we created as one. Even if nothing results from this conference, it is satisfying to know that countries around the world want something to come out.\n\n\n","html":"<p>In wake of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris [COP21], it is evident that the issue of climate change is now more important than ever, and with greenhouse gas emissions rising every day, it is paramount that a resolution is found for this problem.<\/p>\n<p>Coined as &#8220;Action Day&#8221;, the conference seeks to &#8216;achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world.&#8217; However, the controversial topic remains; will a mere conference solve one of the biggest problems humanity as ever faced?
