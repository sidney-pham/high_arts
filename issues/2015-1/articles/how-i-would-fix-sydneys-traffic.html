  <p>I travelled to New York recently. Manhattan is a large island, approximately 21 kilometres long or over 250 blocks (admittedly short ones) from the Bronx to the Financial District. I found myself right at the top of the island on one tourist outing, and as an avid public transport enthusiast, I was working out the best way to get back to midtown/downtown.</p>
<p>The Subway was the clear winner, but I was near a bus station and I was curious about the merits of New York City buses. So I did some research and, according to the MTA’s website, two Subway trains would take me 51 minutes to scale the island, including walking time. Not bad.</p>
<p>Two buses (on virtually direct routes) would have taken me 3 hours and 11 minutes. Ouch. Keep in mind this is roughly the distance from Sydney’s CBD to Bankstown, which takes less than an hour and a half on buses in peak hour.</p>
<p>The traffic in New York City is up there with the worst in the world. If it weren’t for such an extensive and (for the most part) reliable underground system, the city would probably implode with the pressure of such great population density.</p>
<p>In Sydney, 59% of commuters drive to work every day. In NYC, that figure is down at 28%. Even then, the major roadways simply don’t flow most of the time.</p>
<p>As Sydney becomes more like New York in housing, culture and economy, since my trip I’ve noticed that it’s also becoming more like it in terms of road congestion. This is bad.</p>
<p>So the key to beating traffic absolutely lies in getting people onto public transport and out of their cars. The New York Subway is so good because there’s lots <strong>of</strong> it, but NYC’s roads are so bad because there’s lots <strong>on</strong> it.</p>
<p>Here’s what I would do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest more in public transport and less in roads. New York has 34 Subway lines, Sydney has 17 (including Olympic Park and Cronulla offshoots). More trains, buses, train lines, bus lanes, light rail, ferries at regular intervals in as many places as possible. Close the blackspots on the Northern Beaches and elsewhere. Make it faster and easier to get on a train or bus. Play people’s incentives by expanding the whole system.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban all private vehicles in the CBD all the time. Accept buses, cyclists, taxis and government delivery vehicles only. London has a congestion tax, but I think that’s regressive and unfair. If a rich person wants a fast route into the CBD, they can catch a taxi. The CBD is the centre of the daily commute and cannot practically entertain all of the cars it does at the moment. Plus, this solution would turn the city beautifully cosmopolitan. Pitt Street mall on every street.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second solution simply must be used in conjunction with the first, but the benefit to the economy from quicker commute times will offset and actually improve initial investments for the NSW Government. I want the trains of New York City with the roads of a country town, all in Sydney.</p>
<p>I can add so much more detail to this article, but I thought it best to be brief. So if you don’t want a 3-hour trip to Bankstown, or do, I’d love to chat/answer questions.</p>
<p>Also read this he’s more eloquent than I am: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/should-we-ban-cars-from-melbournes-cbd-20150413-1mjuvr.html">http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/should-we-ban-cars-from-melbournes-cbd-20150413-1mjuvr.html</a></p>
