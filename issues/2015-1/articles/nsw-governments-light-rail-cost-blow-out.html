  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am an avid political watcher. I just want to add my personal view on the SE light-rail project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand the crucial need for a fast frequent transport service connecting the CBD and the South East. But what I don&#8217;t get is the 1 billion dollar price tag for this project. Cities all over the world can build light rail projects with 100 million or less, including Melbourne. Sure enough, they might not have the glitz and glamour of this proposal but they still carry an almost equivalent number of passengers an hour. The big reasons as to why the SE light rail is costing taxpayers so much money are because of the plans to have battery powered light rail cars in the city part and to have one of the longest, if not, the longest tram cars in the world. It is also important to note that the ones who are managing this tram line and the trams themselves have had numerous allegations and court proceedings over rorts and other financial matters in many developed countries in the world. So when you take into account all of this info, the state Government&#8217;s decision to go ahead with this project is questionable. And never forget the pain, inconvenience and noise this project will bring to the densest parts of our metropolis for a staggering 5 years!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I was the premier of this state or at least the transport minister of NSW, I would consider one of the following options for moving South-Eastern Sydneysiders or indeed Sydneysiders as a whole:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Build a cheap, yet efficient high-frequency light rail network which is built quickly and is hassle free and reliable ( Before the stupid decision to replace tram lines with bus routes, Sydney had the largest tram network in the world. It was also the most patronised transportation system in the golden days of the first half of the 20th century. So light rail is proven to work on our home soil!)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Build a highly capable train network which will easily last for generations into the future (For the past 3 decades NSW is building some of the most expensive train lines in the world whereas other parts of the world can build them for way less than 1 billion dollars. For example the entire Rouse Hill to Chatswood line cost a whopping 10 billion dollars plus. As for comparison, the world&#8217;s longest rail tunnel in the Swiss Alps is 100 km long-that&#8217;s like building a tunnel from the city to Katoomba-and yet it costs less than 8 billion Australian dollars!)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) Even better, to avoid the pain of building expensive transport networks, why don&#8217;t we just change zoning in our city so that instead of commuting to the CBD or &#8216;hub cities&#8217;, we can just take a walk down the road to have high quality schools, tertiary institutions, hospitals, shops, parks, homes, factories and almost everything you can imagine! ( Other cities do this and save billions of dollars and the Greens should really be arguing for this to occur so that more of us will vote for them)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there you have it! Any of these three plans are cheap, reliable and quick to build!</span></p>
