  <p><em>Americans think they invented democracy. All British people are posh and rude.  All Australian people are drunk and stupid. All Americans are rapists and murderers. These are all stupid stereotypes that are overlooked and do not get a say in society anymore, because they make no sense and are not true. So why does the stereotype “All Muslim people are terrorists” get so much attention?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Because people need something or someone to blame. Isn’t it much easier to blame a religion for the wars that are raging instead of admitting society and humanity are really what sparked these fights? People believe that Islamic State, after murdering so many people, are still accepted in the Muslim community, but in truth, they are despised and hated for doing bad in the name of the Islamic God, by all Muslims.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Muslims are not bad all bad, but you may be thinking, what about ISIS? How can you say these Muslims are not bad? Because they aren’t Muslims. They may claim to be, but in truth shouting “God is All” while killing it not going to put them in heaven, and nearly every Muslim person I know or have spoken to can agree, ISIS are not Muslims, and they will rot in hell.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>And all of this is written from the perspective of a Christian person. I believe in accepting all people just as Jesus Christ says to, and even though I don’t believe in Islam, this is not a valid reason for me to hate Muslims. Just like not being religious is not a valid reason to hate religion. Just like not being American is not a valid reason to hate Obama. Just like not being in Ms. Jollies class is not a valid reason to hate Ms. Jollie.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>So I will end on this note,</em></p>
<p><em>If all of these dumb, untrue stereotypes have passed through without defining society, why does one, stupid stereotype define the way the world thinks?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
